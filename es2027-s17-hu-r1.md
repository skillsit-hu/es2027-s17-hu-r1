# 1 Landing Website (Phase 1)

<img src="./media/phase-1/design/hero.png" alt="Hero Section">

**SkillShare Academy** envisions a visually stunning showcase website that captures the essence of their platform, enticing users to explore their modern experience. The website structure, detailed pages, and section requirements are outlined below.

For this phase, you are limited to using **vanilla HTML and CSS only. JavaScript is not allowed.**

## 1.1 Design

The graphic designer has **prepared the landing page design** for both desktop and mobile. Your task is to implement this design with **pixel-perfect precision**. The design assets are provided in the [`media/phase-1/design`](./media/phase-1/design) folder.

### 1.1.1 Custom font

The 'Poppins' custom font should be used throughout the website. Please make sure that the font is displayed correctly, even if **the user does not have it installed on their system**. You may download the necessary font files from the internet.

### 1.1.2 Smooth animations

It is the competitor's task to make the website feel smooth: hover effects, smooth scrolling, small animations. The animations should be subtle, not bothering the viewer. It should improve UX.

## 1.2 Sections

### 1.2.1 Header, navigation, hero

#### 1.2.1.1 Discount

At the top of the site, a sripe is visible, reminding the users about the discount.

#### 1.2.1.2 Header

- On the header, a few basic information are visible: logo, search bar, join button.
- When the search bar is active, its border should change to the primary purple.
- On mobile, only the logo and the CTA button is visible.

#### 1.2.1.3 Categories

- Below the header, there is a line displaying the featured categories
- One category should act as a link, which currently do not point to anywhere
- On mobile, the categories are displayed in one line, and it is possible to view them by scrolling left to right. On the very right side, there is a small grey overlay, indicating that it is possible to scroll.

#### 1.2.1.4 Hero Section

- The hero secetion displays multiple information. However, on mobile, the hero image is not visible.
- The CTA button should point to your solution of Phase 2
- The "Join with us" part displays some avatars, which are overlapping by default. This acts as a link, pointing to nothing. But on hover, the avatars should 'unfold', making every avatar visible one-by-one, without overlapping. This should happen with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.2 Trusted By

- This section displays some companies in a list.
- On mobile, they are still displayed as a line, and scrolling left and right is possible.

### 1.2.3 Trending courses

- Some featured courses are displayed, with a tab selector
- Always 4 cards are displayed, and switching between the tabs toggles the cards, and updates the tab's active state:
  1. By default, the 'Technology & Software' is selected. 4 cards are displayed, becase these belong to this category
  2. I click on the 'Design & UX/UI' tab. This tab gets the active state (the color and the underline), and the corresponding cards appear
  3. I can click back-and-forth among the tabs, the behaviour should be always as expected
- On mobile, the tabs can be scrolled left and right. Please take into account that in the future, more tabs can appear. Also, only the first course's image is visible

### 1.2.4 Limited deals

- Section displaying some text content and two cards
- The "Ends in" timer is static, does not need to actually count down
- When the cards are hovered, the image is zoomed with a transition, without leaving the container

### 1.2.5 Key Benefits

- This section shows some key benefits, with some text content and a catchy image
- The image is not visible on mobile

### 1.2.6 Explore

- The explore section displays some buttons, which act as links, currently pointing no nothing
- Hovering these cards highlightes the border with the primary color, and scales them a little bit, with a smooth transition

### 1.2.7 Learner Ratings

- This section displays testimonial cards in a horizontal list
- This list continously moves from left to right without ever stopping. This should present with an infinite marquee effect. On hover, the animation should stop
- On mobile, however, only the first 2 testimonial is shown in a list, without any effect

### 1.2.8 Footer

- Footer displaying some essential links, some copyright, and social logos.

## 1.3 Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks appealing across **all screen sizes.**
- The design is provided for **two specific viewports**: `1440px` and `402px`. We will use these viewports to assess your work.
- **The page should also work seamlessly on other screen sizes.** When shrinking, the elements should not stick to the edge of the screen, and the text should not overflow. The content should be in a **container**, so enlarging the screen keeps the size.
- Use relative size units, so changing the font size in the browser settings also shrinks/enlarges the content accordingly.

## 1.4 Accessibility

You should meticulously **apply accessibility standards** (WCAG) to ensure that the website is inclusive and can be used by all users, regardless of their abilities. This will involve providing alternative text for images, semantic HTML elements, and proper ARIA attributes. Also, I can use tab to navigate throughout the website, and the currently tabbed element is highlighted in some way.

## 1.5 SEO Best Practices

Incorporate SEO best practices into the website's **HTML structure** and **meta tags**, optimizing it for search engine visibility and ranking. This will increase Sudsy's online presence and attract organic traffic.

- Please use **semantic** HTML elements where possible.
- Adding **meta** tags and well-structured content.

## 1.6 Validation

The website will thoroughly test on the latest stable versions of **Google Chrome**. W3C also will be used to check for HTML and CSS validity.  
Lighthouse will be used for accessibility and SEO testing. Every lighthouse aspect should be green on both desktop and mobile.

# 1 Landing Website (Phase 1)

<img src="./media/phase-1/design/hero.png" alt="Hero Section">

**SkillShare Academy** envisions a visually stunning showcase website that captures the essence of their platform, enticing users to explore their modern experience. The website structure, detailed pages, and section requirements are outlined below.

For this phase, you are limited to using **vanilla HTML and CSS only. JavaScript is not allowed.**

## 1.1 Design

The graphic designer has **prepared the landing page design** for both desktop and mobile. Your task is to implement this design with **pixel-perfect precision**. The design assets are provided in the [`media/phase-1/design`](./media/phase-1/design) folder.

Along with the design, you are provided with the **text content** as well as txt files.

### 1.1.1 Custom font

The `'Poppins'` custom font should be used throughout the website. Please ensure that the font displays correctly, even if the **user does not have it installed on their system**. You can download the necessary font files from the internet.

### 1.1.2 Smooth animations

The competitor's task is to ensure the website **feels smooth**, with features such as hover effects, smooth scrolling and subtle animations. The animations should be subtle and not distract the viewer. They should improve UX.

## 1.2 Sections

### 1.2.1 Header, navigation, hero

#### 1.2.1.1 Discount

- At the top of the site, there is a **banner** reminding users about the discount.

#### 1.2.1.2 Header

- The header contains a few pieces of basic information: **the logo, the search bar and the 'Join' button**.
- When the search bar is active, its border should **change to** the primary purple color.
- On mobile, only the logo and the CTA button are visible.

#### 1.2.1.3 Categories

- Below the header is a line displaying the featured categories.
- One category acts as a link that currently does not lead anywhere.
- On mobile, the categories are displayed in a single line and can be viewed by **scrolling left to right**. On the far right, there is a small grey overlay indicating that scrolling is possible.

#### 1.2.1.4 Hero Section

- The hero section displays multiple pieces of information. However, on mobile, the hero image is not visible.
- The CTA button should link to your **Phase 2 solution**.
- The "Join with us" section displays avatars that overlap by default. Currently, this acts as a link that points to nothing. When you hover over it, **the avatars should "unfold"**, making each avatar visible one by one without overlapping. This should happen with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.2 Trusted By

- This section displays a list of companies.
- On mobile, they are displayed **as a line**, and left- and right-scrolling is possible.

### 1.2.3 Trending Courses

- Some featured courses are displayed with a **tab selector**.
- Four cards per tab are displayed, **and switching between tabs toggles the cards** and updates the active tab.
  1. By default, 'Technology & Software' is selected. Four cards are displayed because these belong to this category.
  2. I click on the "Design & UX/UI" tab. The tab becomes active (it gets a color and an underline), and the corresponding cards appear.
  3. I can click back and forth among the tabs; the behavior should always be as expected.
     On mobile, the tabs can be scrolled left or right. Please note that more tabs may appear in the future. Also, only the image of the first course is visible.

### 1.2.4 Limited deals

- This section displays text content and two cards.
- The "Ends in" timer is static and does not need to count down.
- When the cards are hovered over, **the image zooms in** with a transition without leaving the container.

### 1.2.5 Key Benefits

- This section shows **key benefits** with text and a catchy image.
- The image is not visible on mobile.

### 1.2.6 Explore

- The Explore section **displays buttons** that act as links, but currently point to nothing.
- Hovering over these cards highlights the border with the primary color and scales them slightly with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.7 Learner Ratings

- This section displays **testimonial cards** in a horizontal list.
- This list continuously moves from left to right without ever stopping. The effect should resemble an infinite marquee. When you hover over it, the animation should stop.
- On mobile, however, only the first two testimonials are shown in a list without any effect.

### 1.2.8 Footer

- The footer displays essential links, copyright information, and social logos.

## 1.3 Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks appealing across **all screen sizes.**
- The design is provided for **two specific viewports**: `1440px` and `402px`. We will use these viewports to assess your work.
- **The page should also work seamlessly on other screen sizes.** When shrinking, the elements should not stick to the edge of the screen, and the text should not overflow. The content should be in a **container**, so enlarging the screen keeps the size.
- Use relative size units, so changing the font size in the browser settings also shrinks/enlarges the content accordingly.

## 1.4 Accessibility

You should meticulously **apply accessibility standards** (WCAG) to ensure that the website is inclusive and can be used by all users, regardless of their abilities. This will involve providing alternative text for images, semantic HTML elements, and proper ARIA attributes. Also, I can use tab to navigate throughout the website, and the currently tabbed element is highlighted in some way.

## 1.5 SEO Best Practices

Incorporate SEO best practices into the website's **HTML structure** and **meta tags**, optimizing it for search engine visibility and ranking. This will increase Sudsy's online presence and attract organic traffic.

- Please use **semantic** HTML elements where possible.
- Adding **meta** tags and well-structured content.

## 1.6 Validation

The website will thoroughly test on the latest stable versions of **Google Chrome**. W3C also will be used to check for HTML and CSS validity.  
Lighthouse will be used for accessibility and SEO testing. Every lighthouse aspect should be green on both desktop and mobile.

# 2 Gantt Chart (Phase 2)

On the second phase, the competitor's task is to create a Gantt Chart, which visualizes the courses in a comprehensible way.

<img src="./media/phase-2/solution/image.png" alt="Example Image">

The gantt chart has multiple functionalities, which the competitor must implement. The main goal of this chart is that the user is able to view the courses by scrolling left and right, seeing the overlaps, the languages, and every important informaton.

You are also provided with some JSON files as example data. You must fetch these JSON files simulating an API request.

You can see a video example on how the chart works in the media files.

## 2.1 The chart itself

- The chart only displays 2026 march! You do not need to worry about other dates.
- If a course does not start in march, or does not end in march, it gets cut
  - For example, a course starts on 03.30 and ends on 04.02, then on the chart, only the 03.30 and 03.31 is visible.
- At the top line of the chart, the days are visible.
  - The days always have the same width.
  - The date and the name of the day (3 letters) should be present as well.
  - If the day is a weekend, then the name of the day should be red.
  - The days should obviously scroll with the chart
- After fetching the courses, display them on the chart:
  - There should not be any overlapping courses on the chart: they are always wrapped on the next line
  - Scrolling the chart left to right is possible, so the user is able to view the whole chart
  - One course card always takes us as much days as it is, and the card always starts at the course's starting date, and ends accordingly
    - For example, if there is a course from 03.02 - 03.04, then the cards is 3 days width: 03.02, 03.03, 03.04
- Day indicator lines are visible below the chart. At the end of every day, there is a dashed subtle line (below the cards), indicating when a day starts and ends. The weekend days have darker background on the chart
- Since March 15. is a special day in hungary, we would like to highlight this. At the middle of March 15, a red line should be placed with the title of "Hungarian Revolution". The title should be visible without overlapping any other useful information. The day card at the top also gets highlighted with subtle colors. Please refer to the video example for a better visual explanation.

## 2.2 The course cards

- The course cards are displayed on the chart, according to the description above
- These cards display a lot of useful information
- The cards are links with a hover effect, currently not pointing to anywhere
- Different categories are highlighted visually with a colored left border. You may choose the colors yourself, where every category has one color
- At the top of the cards, the start and end time is displayed.
  - This chip acts as a button: clicking this badge downloads the appropriate Calendar file, which users can add to their calendars. The correct starting and ending dates, along with detailed course information automatically appears in the calendar as well, hence the Calendar file should contain the correct informations.
- Below, the name of the course is placed, along with a flag emoji. Only English, Hungarian and Chinese languages are supported now. If the course language is not english, the english name is shown too. The titles never break into multiple lines, insted if they can't fit in one line, dots appear at the end...
- The course difficulty with an emoji and the price is also displayed. The price is always displayed in the selected currency - see more information later. The price should never display more than 2 decimal points.
- Finally at the last line, the instructor should be named.
- Tooltips:
  - The course cards have tooltips everywhere
  - Hovering the timeframe shows the full start and end time (YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm), and a label "add to calendar"
  - Hovering every other element individually displays it in full form -> for example if the title doesn't fit and is dotted, and the user still wants to see the information, they can do so by hovering
  - Hovering the price always shows the EUR as well
  - These tooltips should be custom tooltips - not the default browser `title`

## 2.3 Action buttons

- To make the UX better, we designed various action buttons
- On the chart, there are two lines: these lines scroll the chart left and right, so it is possible to scroll without the native scrollbar.
- Above the chart, there is an additional line
  - It displays "2026. March"
  - A search bar -> the search bar is debounced (300 ms). The search bar searches in every relevant field of the course, and when the user searches, only the found courses are shown. However, they do not shift from their original position. Please refer to the video example
  - Currency Selector: The user can choose between EUR, HUF and CYN currencies. After selecting the currency, the course cards price gets displayed in this currency. You can find a currencies.json file, displaying the value of 1 EUR, you should use this to exchange. The selected currency is restored after page refresh or browser reload.
  - Full Screen: This button toggles the chart in full screen. While the fullscreen mode is active, the browser and OS controls are also invisible, and pressing the 'ESC' key exits the fullscreen.
  - Export: exports the courses (ordered by start date) into a CSV file. Always the EUR currency should be used in the export. The export should contain every attribute (with the field names in the first line). The exported CSV after can be imported in an Excel easily.
  - +/- buttons: Clicking these buttons zooms in/out on the chart. See a video as example. However, it is impossible to click these buttons forever: after shrinking to a very small amount, or zooming to a very big amount, the buttons should be disabled.

## 2.4 Design

- You should briefly follow the design of the provided examples, however, it is not expected to be pixel-perfect. The overall UI should feel clean, modern, and easy to use. Please use emojis where possible to make it look better.
- The UI should be designed to Desktop devices, above 1000px width.

## 2.5 Accessibility

- The chart is accessible. Which means that using only my keyboard, users can do everything. The currently tabbed item is always highlighted, so the user knows where they are. Even adding to the calendar or zooming is possible. If a user highlighs a course with tabbing, the chart automatically scrolls there.
- Additionally, there are keybord shortcuts:
  - Ctrl D: Highlights the search bar
  - Ctrl +: Zooms in the chart (same as + button)
  - Ctrl -: Zooms out the chart (same as - button)
  - Ctrl E: Export
  - Ctrl B: Fullscreen
  - Left Arrow: Scrolls left
  - Right Arrow: Scrolls Right

## 2.6 Library, Framework, and NPM Module Limitations

- You are allowed to use only the following JavaScript frameworks: **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**
- Create the project using one of the following commands:
  - React: `npm vite@latest phase-2-src -- --template react`
  - Vue: `npm vite@latest phase-2-src -- --template vue`
  - Angular: `ng new phase-2-src`
- You are allowed to use TailwindCSS, which you may configure to your liking (however!, no extra plugins, no shadcn, etc.)
- You are **NOT** allowed to use any other JS or CSS frameworks or libs (e.g Next.js, Bootstrap)
- You can use npm modules installed by the default project creation process of the selected JS framework (see above). It is also **forbidden** to use additional npm modules in your JS framework project.

Submitted by: [Skills IT](https://skillsit.hu)

You've been working as a **freelance web developer**, but now you're aiming to secure a developer position at a promising new startup: **SkillShare Academy**. To evaluate your skills, the company's management has asked you to develop a **prototype** for their innovative service as part of the hiring process.

In this round, your task is to create a visually compelling and engaging **website** that highlights SkillShare Academy as a cutting-edge platform.

You will leverage your **HTML and CSS** expertise to craft a website that is visually appealing, meets accessibility standards, and implements SEO best practices. Additionally, you'll demonstrate your proficiency with **JavaScript libraries** like React, Vue or Angular by creating an advanced gantt chart that visualizes multiple lessons in a comprehensible way.

**The development process is divided into two phases:**

- **Phase 1:** You will create the website using only **vanilla HTML and CSS**. All related work files should be placed in the `phase-1` folder.
- **Phase 2:** You will develop the project using a **JavaScript framework** such as React, Vue, or Angular. Organize your source files in the `phase-2-src` folder, and place the built project in the `phase-2` folder for deployment purposes.

Every needed media, icons and text have been provided for you in the [`media`](./media) folder. You are free to use these. **You should not use any other media files** _(e.g. downloaded videos, images, icons, etc.)_.

# 1 Landing Website (Phase 1)

<img src="./media/phase-1/design/hero.png" alt="Hero Section">

**SkillShare Academy** envisions a visually stunning showcase website that captures the essence of their platform, enticing users to explore their modern experience. The website structure, detailed pages, and section requirements are outlined below.

For this phase, you are limited to using **vanilla HTML and CSS only. JavaScript is not allowed.**

## 1.1 Design

The graphic designer has **prepared the landing page design** for both desktop and mobile. Your task is to implement this design with **pixel-perfect precision**. The design assets are provided in the [`media/phase-1/design`](./media/phase-1/design) folder.

Along with the design, you are provided with the **text content** as well as txt files.

### 1.1.1 Custom font

The `'Poppins'` custom font should be used throughout the website. Please ensure that the font displays correctly, even if the **user does not have it installed on their system**. You can download the necessary font files from the internet.

### 1.1.2 Smooth animations

The competitor's task is to ensure the website **feels smooth**, with features such as hover effects, smooth scrolling and subtle animations. The animations should be subtle and not distract the viewer. They should improve UX.

## 1.2 Sections

### 1.2.1 Header, navigation, hero

#### 1.2.1.1 Discount

- At the top of the site, there is a **banner** reminding users about the discount.

#### 1.2.1.2 Header

- The header contains a few pieces of basic information: **the logo, the search bar and the 'Join' button**.
- When the search bar is active, its border should **change to** the primary purple color.
- On mobile, only the logo and the CTA button are visible.

#### 1.2.1.3 Categories

- Below the header is a line displaying the featured categories.
- One category acts as a link that currently does not lead anywhere.
- On mobile, the categories are displayed in a single line and can be viewed by **scrolling left to right**. On the far right, there is a small grey overlay indicating that scrolling is possible.

#### 1.2.1.4 Hero Section

- The hero section displays multiple pieces of information. However, on mobile, the hero image is not visible.
- The CTA button should link to your **Phase 2 solution**.
- The "Join with us" section displays avatars that overlap by default. Currently, this acts as a link that points to nothing. When you hover over it, **the avatars should "unfold"**, making each avatar visible one by one without overlapping. This should happen with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.2 Trusted By

- This section displays a list of companies.
- On mobile, they are displayed **as a line**, and left- and right-scrolling is possible.

### 1.2.3 Trending Courses

- Some featured courses are displayed with a **tab selector**.
- Four cards per tab are displayed, **and switching between tabs toggles the cards** and updates the active tab.
  1. By default, 'Technology & Software' is selected. Four cards are displayed because these belong to this category.
  2. I click on the "Design & UX/UI" tab. The tab becomes active (it gets a color and an underline), and the corresponding cards appear.
  3. I can click back and forth among the tabs; the behavior should always be as expected.
     On mobile, the tabs can be scrolled left or right. Please note that more tabs may appear in the future. Also, only the image of the first course is visible.

### 1.2.4 Limited deals

- This section displays text content and two cards.
- The "Ends in" timer is static and does not need to count down.
- When the cards are hovered over, **the image zooms in** with a transition without leaving the container.

### 1.2.5 Key Benefits

- This section shows **key benefits** with text and a catchy image.
- The image is not visible on mobile.

### 1.2.6 Explore

- The Explore section **displays buttons** that act as links, but currently point to nothing.
- Hovering over these cards highlights the border with the primary color and scales them slightly with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.7 Learner Ratings

- This section displays **testimonial cards** in a horizontal list.
- This list continuously moves from left to right without ever stopping. The effect should resemble an infinite marquee. When you hover over it, the animation should stop.
- On mobile, however, only the first two testimonials are shown in a list without any effect.

### 1.2.8 Footer

- The footer displays essential links, copyright information, and social logos.

## 1.3 Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks appealing across **all screen sizes.**
- The design is provided for **two specific viewports**: `1440px` and `402px`. We will use these viewports to assess your work.
- **The page should also work seamlessly on other screen sizes.** When shrinking, the elements should not stick to the edge of the screen, and the text should not overflow. The content should be in a **container**, so enlarging the screen keeps the size.
- Use relative size units, so changing the font size in the browser settings also shrinks/enlarges the content accordingly.

## 1.4 Accessibility

You should meticulously **apply accessibility standards** (WCAG) to ensure that the website is inclusive and can be used by all users, regardless of their abilities. This will involve providing alternative text for images, semantic HTML elements, and proper ARIA attributes. Also, I can use tab to navigate throughout the website, and the currently tabbed element is highlighted in some way.

## 1.5 SEO Best Practices

Incorporate SEO best practices into the website's **HTML structure** and **meta tags**, optimizing it for search engine visibility and ranking. This will increase Sudsy's online presence and attract organic traffic.

- Please use **semantic** HTML elements where possible.
- Adding **meta** tags and well-structured content.

## 1.6 Validation

The website will thoroughly test on the latest stable versions of **Google Chrome**. W3C also will be used to check for HTML and CSS validity.  
Lighthouse will be used for accessibility and SEO testing. Every lighthouse aspect should be green on both desktop and mobile.

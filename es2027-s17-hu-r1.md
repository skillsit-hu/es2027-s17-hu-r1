# 1 Landing Website (Phase 1)

<img src="./media/phase-1/design/hero.png" alt="Hero Section">

**SkillShare Academy** envisions a visually stunning showcase website that captures the essence of their platform, enticing users to explore their modern experience. The website structure, detailed pages, and section requirements are outlined below.

For this phase, you are limited to using **vanilla HTML and CSS only. JavaScript is not allowed.**

## 1.1 Design

The graphic designer has **prepared the landing page design** for both desktop and mobile. Your task is to implement this design with **pixel-perfect precision**. The design assets are provided in the [`media/phase-1/design`](./media/phase-1/design) folder.

Along with the design, you are provided with the **text content** as well as txt files.

### 1.1.1 Custom font

The `'Poppins'` custom font should be used throughout the website. Please ensure that the font displays correctly, even if the **user does not have it installed on their system**. You can download the necessary font files from the internet.

### 1.1.2 Smooth animations

The competitor's task is to ensure the website **feels smooth**, with features such as hover effects, smooth scrolling and subtle animations. The animations should be subtle and not distract the viewer. They should improve UX.

## 1.2 Sections

### 1.2.1 Header, navigation, hero

#### 1.2.1.1 Discount

- At the top of the site, there is a **banner** reminding users about the discount.

#### 1.2.1.2 Header

- The header contains a few pieces of basic information: **the logo, the search bar and the 'Join' button**.
- When the search bar is active, its border should **change to** the primary purple color.
- On mobile, only the logo and the CTA button are visible.

#### 1.2.1.3 Categories

- Below the header is a line displaying the featured categories.
- One category acts as a link that currently does not lead anywhere.
- On mobile, the categories are displayed in a single line and can be viewed by **scrolling left to right**. On the far right, there is a small grey overlay indicating that scrolling is possible.

#### 1.2.1.4 Hero Section

- The hero section displays multiple pieces of information. However, on mobile, the hero image is not visible.
- The CTA button should link to your **Phase 2 solution**.
- The "Join with us" section displays avatars that overlap by default. Currently, this acts as a link that points to nothing. When you hover over it, **the avatars should "unfold"**, making each avatar visible one by one without overlapping. This should happen with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.2 Trusted By

- This section displays a list of companies.
- On mobile, they are displayed **as a line**, and left- and right-scrolling is possible.

### 1.2.3 Trending Courses

- Some featured courses are displayed with a **tab selector**.
- The course card can display **any user avatars**.
- Four cards per tab are displayed, **and switching between tabs toggles the cards** and updates the active tab.
  1. By default, 'Technology & Software' is selected. Four cards are displayed because these belong to this category.
  2. I click on the "Design & UX/UI" tab. The tab becomes active (it gets a color and an underline), and the corresponding cards appear.
  3. I can click back and forth among the tabs; the behavior should always be as expected.
     On mobile, the tabs can be scrolled left or right. Please note that more tabs may appear in the future. Also, only the image of the first course is visible.

### 1.2.4 Limited deals

- This section displays text content and two cards.
- The "Ends in" timer is static and does not need to count down.
- When the cards are hovered over, **the image zooms in** with a transition without leaving the container.

### 1.2.5 Key Benefits

- This section shows **key benefits** with text and a catchy image.
- The image is not visible on mobile.

### 1.2.6 Explore

- The Explore section **displays buttons** that act as links, but currently point to nothing.
- Hovering over these cards highlights the border with the primary color and scales them slightly with a smooth transition.

### 1.2.7 Learner Ratings

- This section displays **testimonial cards** in a horizontal list.
- This list continuously moves from left to right without ever stopping. The effect should resemble an infinite marquee. When you hover over it, the animation should stop.
- On mobile, however, only the first two testimonials are shown in a list without any effect.

### 1.2.8 Footer

- The footer displays essential links, copyright information, and social logos.

## 1.3 Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks appealing across **all screen sizes.**
- The design is provided for **two specific viewports**: `1440px` and `402px`. We will use these viewports to assess your work.
- **The page should also work seamlessly on other screen sizes.** When shrinking, the elements should not stick to the edge of the screen, and the text should not overflow. The content should be in a **container**, so enlarging the screen keeps the size.
- Use relative size units, so changing the font size in the browser settings also shrinks/enlarges the content accordingly.

## 1.4 Accessibility

You should meticulously **apply accessibility standards** (WCAG) to ensure that the website is inclusive and can be used by all users, regardless of their abilities. This will involve providing alternative text for images, semantic HTML elements, and proper ARIA attributes. Also, I can use tab to navigate throughout the website, and the currently tabbed element is highlighted in some way.

## 1.5 SEO Best Practices

Incorporate SEO best practices into the website's **HTML structure** and **meta tags**, optimizing it for search engine visibility and ranking. This will increase Sudsy's online presence and attract organic traffic.

- Please use **semantic** HTML elements where possible.
- Adding **meta** tags and well-structured content.

## 1.6 Validation

The website will thoroughly test on the latest stable versions of **Google Chrome**. W3C also will be used to check for HTML and CSS validity.  
Lighthouse will be used for accessibility and SEO testing. Every lighthouse aspect should be green on both desktop and mobile.

# 2 Gantt Chart (Phase 2)

In the second phase, competitors must create a **Gantt chart** to visualize the courses.

<img src="./media/phase-2/solution/image.png" alt="Example Image">

The Gantt chart has **multiple functionalities** that the competitor must implement. The main goal of the chart is to **allow users to view courses by scrolling left and right** to see overlaps, languages, and other important information.

Some **JSON files are provided** as example data. You must fetch these JSON files, simulating an API request.

You can view a [video example](./media/phase-2/solution/example.mov) of how the chart works in the media files.

## 2.1 The chart itself

- The chart only displays **March 2026**! You don't need to worry about other dates.
- If a course does not start or end in March, **it is cut**.
  - _For example, if a course starts on March 30th and ends on April 2nd, then on the chart, only March 30th and 31st are visible. Of course, on the card, still April 2nd can be seen._
- At the top of the chart, **the days are visible**.
  - The days always have the **same width**.
  - The date and the three-letter day of the week should also be present.
  - **If the day is a weekend**, the day's name should be in red.
  - The days should obviously scroll with the chart.
- After fetching the courses, **display them on the chart**:
  - There should be **no overlapping** courses on the chart; they should always be wrapped to the next line. This functionality should be dynamic, and should work on every dataset.
  - **Scrolling the chart from left to right** should be possible so that the user can view the entire chart.
  - One course card always takes up as many days as the course, and the card always starts on the course's start date and ends accordingly.
    - **For example**, if a course is from 03.02 to 03.04, the **card is three days wide**: 03.02, 03.03, and 03.04.
- Day indicator lines are visible below the chart. A **dashed line** appears below the cards at the end of **every day**, indicating when a day starts and ends. The weekend days have a **darker background** on the chart.
- Since March 15 is a **special day in Hungary**, we would like to highlight it. A red line with the title "Hungarian Revolution" should be placed in the **middle of March 15**. The title should be visible without overlapping any other useful information. The day card at the top is also highlighted with subtle colors. _Please refer to the video example for a better visual explanation._

## 2.2 The course cards

- The course cards are displayed on the chart according to the above description.
- The cards **are links** with a **hover effect** that currently don't point to anything.
- Different categories are visually highlighted **with a colored left border**. You may choose the colors yourself, with each category having its own color.
- The **start and end time** is displayed at the top of the cards.
  - This chip **acts as a button**; clicking it downloads the appropriate **calendar file**, which **users can add to their calendars**. The correct start and end dates, along with detailed course information, automatically appear in the calendar. Hence, the calendar file should contain the correct information.
- Below that, the **course name** is displayed along with a flag emoji. Currently, only English, Hungarian, and Chinese are supported. If the course language is **not English**, the English name is also shown. **Titles never break into multiple lines**. Instead, if they can't fit on one line, dots appear at the end.
- The course difficulty and price are also displayed with an emoji. **The price is always displayed in the selected currency.** See the section below for more information. The price should never have more than two decimal places.
- Finally, the instructor's name is displayed on the last line.
- The content of the card is **sticky** when scrolling left to right. Please refer to the video example on the functionality.
- **Tooltips:**

  - Hovering over the **timeframe** shows the full start and end time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) and a **"Add to Calendar"** label.
  - Hovering over every other element individually displays the full form. _For example, if the title is dotted because it doesn't fit, the user can hover over it to see the full title._
  - Hovering over the **price** always shows the price in EUR.
  - These tooltips should be custom tooltips, **not the default browser "title"**.

## 2.3 Action buttons

- To **improve the user experience** (UX), we designed various action buttons.
- On the chart, there are **two buttons** that scroll the chart left and right. This makes it possible to scroll without using the native scroll bar.
- **Above the chart is an additional line.**

  - It displays "2026." March."
  - The search bar is **debounced** (300 ms). It searches every **relevant field** of the course, and only the found courses are shown when the user searches. However, the courses **do not shift** from their original position. Please refer to the video example.
  - _Currency Selector:_ The user can choose from EUR, HUF, and CYN. After selecting a currency, **the price of the course cards is displayed in that currency**. You can find a `currencies.json` file displaying the value of 1 EUR; **use this file for exchanges**. The selected currency is **restored** after refreshing the page or reloading the browser.
  - _Full Screen:_ This button toggles the chart to **full-screen mode**. While full-screen mode is active, **the browser and OS controls are invisible**. Pressing the "ESC" key exits full-screen mode.
  - _Export:_ This option **exports the courses** (ordered by start date) into a `CSV` file. The EUR currency should always be used in the export. The export **should contain every attribute**, with the field names on the first line. The exported CSV file can easily be imported **into Excel**.
  - _The +/- buttons:_ Clicking these buttons **zooms in or out** on the chart. See the video for an example. However, it is impossible to click these buttons indefinitely. After shrinking or zooming to the maximum extent, the buttons should be disabled. You may define this "maximum" value with a good UX mindset.

## 2.4 Design

- You should **follow the design** of the provided examples, but it is **not expected** to be pixel-perfect. The overall UI should look **clean and modern** and be easy to use. Use emojis where possible to improve the appearance.
- The UI should be designed for **desktop** devices with a width of at least 1000px.

## 2.5 Accessibility

- The chart is **accessible**. This means that users can do everything **using only their keyboard**. The currently selected tab is always highlighted so users know where they are. They can even add to the calendar or zoom. If a user highlights a course with the tab key, the chart automatically scrolls to that course.
- Aria labels and tooltips are added wherever necessary to allow screen readers to navigate easily.
- **Additionally, there are keybord shortcuts:**
  - `Ctrl D`: Highlights the search bar
  - `Ctrl +`: Zooms in the chart (same as + button)
  - `Ctrl -`: Zooms out the chart (same as - button)
  - `Ctrl E`: Export
  - `Ctrl B`: Fullscreen
  - `Left Arrow`: Scrolls left
  - `Right Arrow`: Scrolls Right

## 2.6 Library, Framework, and NPM Module Limitations

- You are allowed to use only the following JavaScript frameworks: **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**
- Create the project using one of the following commands:
  - React: `npm vite@latest phase-2-src -- --template react`
  - Vue: `npm vite@latest phase-2-src -- --template vue`
  - Angular: `ng new phase-2-src`
- You are allowed to use TailwindCSS, which you may configure to your liking (however!, no extra plugins, no shadcn, etc.)
- You are **NOT** allowed to use any other JS or CSS frameworks or libs (e.g Next.js, Bootstrap)
- You can use npm modules installed by the default project creation process of the selected JS framework (see above). It is also **forbidden** to use additional npm modules in your JS framework project.

# 3 Instructions to the Competitor

## 3.1 Clean Code

Clean code is also an important consideration.

- **Comments**: Include the appropriate amount of comments in your HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- **Consistent naming**: Use meaningful, descriptive names that follow a consistent style, such as camelCase for JavaScript or kebab-case for CSS.
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Break code into reusable modules or components to reduce redundancy and simplify maintenance.
- **Smart framework usage**: Use frameworks and libraries efficiently to write concise, effective code that avoids unnecessary dependencies.

## 3.2 Git usage

Proper use of Git is crucial for maintaining a clean, organized, and collaborative development workflow. Follow these guidelines to ensure professionalism:

- **Meaningful Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what changes were made and why. Avoid generic messages like `"fix"` or `"update"`.
- **Frequent Commits:** Commit changes regularly to maintain a logical history of your progress. Avoid large, monolithic commits that bundle unrelated changes together.

## 3.3 Project structure and deployment

### 3.3.1 Folders

- **Phase 1:** Place all your work files in the `phase-1` folder.
- **Phase 2:** Organize your source files in the `phase-2-src` folder, and store the built project in the `phase-2` folder. This built version will be used for deployment.

### 3.3.2 Deployment

Netlify is a **free service** for hosting static websites, making it **easy to share** your project with the public. The platform automatically publishes updates when linked to a Git repository.

1. **Register** for an account on Netlify.
2. Create a new application for your website and link it to your GitHub repository.
3. Choose a hostname for your application.
4. Document the chosen hostname on the first line of your repository's `README.md` file, followed by your ID on the second line and your full name on the third line.

Each phase of your project should be accessible via the following paths:

- `/phase-1` for the **Phase 1** implementation.
- `/phase-2` for the **Phase 2** implementation.

By adhering to the folder structure described above, this setup will work seamlessly.

Additionally, include a basic `index.html` file in the root of your project. This file should serve as a simple page linking to the two phases. The `index.html` file does not require any styling and **will not be assessed**.

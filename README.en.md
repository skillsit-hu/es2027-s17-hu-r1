# EuroSkills Düsseldorf 2027 Hungarian National Competition, Skill 17 (Web Development)

## Round 1

In this round, you need to complete a web development task. While solving the home assignment, you may use any preparation resources, but the task must be completed independently, and the finished work must reflect your abilities and knowledge.

We will evaluate the submitted tasks. Following this, we will select 12 competitors with whom we will conduct an online interview. After the interview, we will select the best 6 competitors, who will then compete against each other in the one-day semi-final. (The expected date of the semi-final is February 28, 2026, Saturday.)

## The Task

You can find the task description in this repository, in the [es2027-s17-hu-r1.md](es2027-s17-hu-r1.md) file.

### How to Submit the Task

The task must be submitted in two forms:

1. **Source Code in GitHub Repository**

   To submit the tasks, you need to share the **GitHub repository** (hereinafter repo) containing your solution's source code with us. If you haven't used GitHub yet, register an account at [https://github.com](https://github.com), then create a private repo named `es2027-s17-r1-YYY`, where **YYY** is the three-digit number you received from us via email.

   Then you need to share the repo containing your solution with us. Use our **`skillsithu`** GitHub username for this.

2. **Publishing the Finished Website (Deploy) Using Netlify Service**

   a. Netlify is a service that can be used for free, where static websites can be shared with the public. The service works by connecting a web application created on Netlify with a GIT repo (in our case, the GitHub repo created for the round's task). When you push a change to the repo, Netlify will immediately publish it on the public URL associated with the app.

   b. Register an account on Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/), create a new app for your website, connect the app to your GitHub repo, then choose an available hostname.

   c. Write the chosen hostname (where your website can be accessed) in the first line of the repo's README file. Write your received identifier in the second line, and your name in the third line.

3. **Tools and Technologies That Can Be Used During the Solution**

   a. The usable tools and technologies are included in the task description.

   b. **IMPORTANT:** Do not use AI coding assistance tools or development environments (Github Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)! Such tools are not permitted in the subsequent rounds of the selection and at the international competition, so avoid using them in the first round as well. We will check the submitted work with a tool designed for this purpose, and anyone for whom it is clearly revealed that they used AI to create the code will be excluded from the competition.

### Deadline

The final deadline for completing the tasks: **January 29, 2026, Thursday, midnight**

**We consider the solution submitted to be what we find in your repo and on your Netlify page at the above time.**
